# Python-development
This repository will contain all of my python programming development, from small basic programmes in the beginning to larger projects down the line.

I am currently working through Head first Python by Paul Barry (15-08-20)

The vsearch4web folder is my first webapp where I have used a combination of Python, HTML and flask which takes a previously made search4letters function and puts it on the web.
